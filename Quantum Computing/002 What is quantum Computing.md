### What is Quantum Computing?

Quantum computing is a type of computer that uses the strange and powerful properties of quantum mechanics to perform certain tasks much faster than regular computers. In normal computers, information is stored as bits that can be either 0 or 1, like a light switch that's either off or on. But in quantum computers, information is stored as quantum bits or qubits, which can be 0, 1, or both at the same time. This ability to be in multiple states simultaneously allows quantum computers to process information in a highly parallel and efficient way, making them potentially much faster for solving specific problems, like complex scientific calculations and cryptography.

### What is Quantum Mechanics then?

Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that **deals with very tiny particles**, like **atoms** and **electrons**. 

It's different from normal mechanics (classical mechanics) because it follows **strange rules**. In quantum mechanics, **things can be in multiple states at once**, **particles can act like both particles and waves**, and **there's inherent uncertainty**. 

This allows quantum computers to solve specific problems, such as **factoring large numbers** or **simulating quantum systems**, more efficiently than classical computers.

Quantum computing is a field where you need the knowledge of multiple disciplinary. You do not have to master all of them but having a basic idea would be helpful in the learning process.
