# 003. Some Strange Behavior in Quantum World

Tags: Quantum Computing

### Quantum World is Mysterious

Quantum physics is a bit like a magical realm, where particles can be in two places at once and do other puzzling things. In this blog, we'll explore these strange behaviors and try to make them easier to understand. So, let's embark on a journey into the amazing, puzzling world of quantum science! I will try to explain you some strange behaviors in Quantum World using the basketball analogy.

### Superposition

In simple terms, superposition in quantum physics means that things like particles or atoms can be in more than one place or state at the same time until we check or measure them. This is very different from everyday objects, which are usually in one place or state at a time. Superposition is a strange but important idea in quantum science and plays a big role in quantum computers.

### Tunneling

Tunneling is a phenomenon in the quantum world where particles, like electrons, can pass through barriers that classical physics says they shouldn't be able to. It's a bit like a ghost going through a wall. This strange behavior is essential in understanding how things work on a very small scale, such as in electronic devices and nuclear reactions. It's one of the many fascinating aspects of quantum physics that make our world work in mysterious ways.

### Quantum Zeno Effect

The quantum Zeno effect is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where frequent measurements or observations of a quantum system can prevent it from evolving or changing. It's named after the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno, who proposed paradoxes involving motion and change.

In the context of quantum mechanics, if you continuously measure a quantum system, it appears to "freeze" in its current state because **the act of measuring disturbs the system and collapses its wave function**. This can make it seem as though the system is not changing over time, even if it would normally evolve or decay without constant measurement.

The quantum Zeno effect has been experimentally observed and is a fascinating aspect of the quantum world, illustrating how measurement and observation can influence the behavior of quantum systems.
