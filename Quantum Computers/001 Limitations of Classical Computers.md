# 001. Limitations of Classical Computers

Tags: Quantum Computing

Classical computers have been the backbone of our digital age, powering everything from scientific research to business operations. However, they do have their limitations. To understand it better,  lets start with an example.

Suppose you are a truck driver and you have to deliver products in 25 different regions throughout United States.

Now, if you want to know the best route to complete your task, do you know how much time a classical computer will take to give you the output? It will take more than **20,000,000 (20 Million)** years. That is crazy right?

Through using the fastest computers during this calculation could reduce some time. But still, the classical computers struggles a lot to solve certain problems like dealing with large datasets and large number of possible combinations.

Other types of problems that classical computers struggles to solve:

And that is where **quantum computes** come in.
